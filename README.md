# Toto_project_CollectData_LotteryData
In this project, I used Python's BeautifulSoup and Selenium libraries to scrape data from the Vietnamese lottery website (stockbiz.vn/IndicesStats.aspx). The script navigates through multiple pages to collect lottery information. The data, including date, period, and winning numbers, was extracted and stored in a CSV file. Using Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn, I analyzed the data and created visualizations to provide insights into lottery trends and patterns. The data visualization showcases the distribution of winning numbers and their occurrences. This project allows users to explore and analyze Vietnamese lottery results efficiently.
